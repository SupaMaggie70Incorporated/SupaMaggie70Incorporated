# Holy shit I'm glad I just deleted whatever was here before

I do some C# stuff, occasionally html or javascript, python once every now and then, and also sometimes java.

Main project right now is private, but the library I use for everything, supastuff, can be found at

This was written a while ago. Now I'm a nomad, I switch from projects and languages as soon as I get bored of them(I have adhd)
